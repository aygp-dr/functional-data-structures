Context: Development environment enhancement for Scheme programming

Considerations:
- Integration with existing functional data structures project
- Support for literate programming workflow with org-mode
- Interactive REPL development with Geiser and Guile3
- Structured editing capabilities with paredit
- Remote development support via TRAMP

Implementation decisions:
- Used .envrc for project variables to support direnv workflow
- Created standalone Emacs config to avoid polluting user's config
- Added tmux session management for persistent development sessions
- Integrated with existing Makefile structure for consistency

Technical details:
- Geiser configured for Guile3 specifically
- Load paths properly set for both Scheme and Hy environments
- Company mode for intelligent auto-completion
- Flycheck for real-time syntax checking
- Rainbow delimiters for better code visibility

Issues addressed:
- Need for interactive Scheme development environment
- Requirement for persistent development sessions
- Integration with existing build system
